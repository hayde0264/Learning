                                                    /* Property wrappers allow you to modify the behavior of property
                                                       declarations. You can use property wrappers for properties of classes
                                                       and structs, local variables and in function arguements.
                                                     
                                                       For each property marked with a property wrapper, the compiler
                                                       generates an actual stored property prefixed with an underscore. When
                                                       defining a property wrapper, you have to provide at least a getter for
                                                       the wrapped value. The setter is optional, and depending on weather
                                                       or not it's present, a setter is generated for the computer property as
                                                       well.
