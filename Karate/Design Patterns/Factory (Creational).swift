                                                        /* The Factory pattern is a good choice if
                                                           you want to prevent exposing all the implementation
                                                           types to our callers. Callers only know the
                                                           prototype or base class. This reduces the
                                                           dependencies within the system.
                                                         
                                                           This pattern allows changing the exsisting
                                                           implementation types or adding new ones without
                                                           exposing their details to the componets that
                                                           rely on them.
