                                                    /* The singleton's goal is to create only one instance
                                                       of a given type. Why would that be useful? Singleton's
                                                       can be great if you need to access and manage a single
                                                       instance throughout your application.
                                                     
                                                       ===================
                                                       HOW TO PROPERTY USE
                                                       ===================
                                                                          1. Only one instance of the given type can be created and shared
                                                                          2. The shared instance can't be cloned
                                                                          3. The singleton instance must be thread-safe since many componets
                                                                             might access it concurrently
                                                                
                                                    */
